## Generator error
This Password Generator is not completed because I was not able to Figure out how to completly finish it. Although I was not able to completly finish the Acceptance Criteria I hope that this will be able to be used to help someone get on the right track if trying to figure out how to do the same thing.

## Description

I was given instructions along with existing code to finish creating a password generator that displays prompts and displays a random password based on your selections. When you click on the "Generate Password" button you will be prompt with a few questions that will then be used to create a random password using JavaScript.
